## Dataset

The Ford GoBike System Data is data collected on 183413 individual rides made in a bike-sharing program in the 
San Francisco Bay Area covering the period of February 2019. The original data is not entirely clean and tidy. 
Some datatypes were changed to more appropriate ones, null values were examined and deleted.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I first found out that the GoBike rides are taken every time of the month. There isn't a single day without any rides.
More rides were taken by Subscribers who had annual memberships than Customers (one time users). 
Similarly, More Males took rides as compared with Females and other genders. I also found out that people within the ages of 20-40 
took the most rides and their rides covered the most distances.Also, out of the 328 GoBike Stations, 
the ones which had most rides beginning from also had the most rides ending at. 
The Stations with the most number of rides were closest to the bayh and the stations which recorded the least number of rides were relatively further away.
I realised also that the ride durations correlated to the distances travelled.


## Key Insights for Presentation

I find the GoBike Stations hold a lot to be unravelled. I will start my presentation with a look at the GoBike Stations and their involvement in the GoBike Rides.
With the use of bar plots, I will find out the Stations with the most activities and least activities and possibly find their locations on an actual map.
The Stations with the most rides are seen to be relatively closer to the shores of the bay than the others.

Secondly I intend to show the distribution of the categorical variables on the stations with the highest and lowest number of rides.
I will do this by representing the categories on a 3 different planes of histograms (One for the User Type, the second for the Member Gender and
the last for Bike Share For All Discount members.
It will be seen that the the charts for the Stations with the most number of rides are skewed. (Male, Subscribers who do not have the Bike Share for all Discount dominate)
For the Stations with the least number of rides, the charts for Member Gender and Bike Share For All discount were relatively different
